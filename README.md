# Simple-Todolist
A To-Do List created using ASP.NET Core. This website utilizes Dapper for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), Bootstrap as the CSS framework, jQuery for dynamically updating the database, and SQL for the database. The website allows users to create sections for specific tasks, and within each section, they can add individual to-do items.
